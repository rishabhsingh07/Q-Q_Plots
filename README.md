# Quantile Quantile Plot

Q-Q plot (Quantile-Quantile) plots are graphs of two
quantiles against each other. The purpose of a QQ plot
is to find whether two sets of data have same distribution.
One very common and standard use of Q-Q plot is to check whether our dataset is normally distributed or not. As most
of the ML algorithms require the dataset to be  gaussian/normally distributed before feeding it to them 
for best results.

#### In this notebook I have visually represented the Q-Q plot for easy understanding
